    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      When I was in high school, I started to think about the relationship between human being and the world. Are we ruling the world? Or we just following the essential rules in the world? If there are intrinsically some basic rules in the world, how should we consummate our living world in the premise of following these rules?
While I immersed myself in these questions, I got an answer that the research on material objects is the key to solve my confusions, which is the foundation of the world. So when I received an admission qualification to Tsinghua University as a 1st prize winner in National Physics Olympiad Competition and got the chance to choose my undergraduate major, I chose Material Science and Engineering. But I didn’t stop thinking about these questions, in the meantime I started to take some courses about mathematical logic from which I learnt to think logically, and I got involved in undergraduate research on electron microscopy, because I attempted to learn more about essence of materials directly, further about the world. However, what got the opposite of my expectant was the cost, the more details you want to learn about what inside the material, the more time and finance you would cost, and the cost will increase exponentially. That gave me motivation to find other ways to realize me pursuit.
After that a course about computational materials science opened a new door for me, computational materials science is a science of methods in which the performance of material is simulated by computer. This process of simulation inspired me at that time, it is just like a mathematical system: we give the basic rules and provide the details of a material such as atom positions, computers take the response for derivation process and give us the result. If the basic rules and the derivation methods are true, the result would agree with the reality, on the other hand, if the result is not true, there must some errors in the basic rules or the derivation process. That means we can use the theory and basic facts which has been proved to predict the result we don’t known, or compare the results from simulation with them from experiment to test a theory, more exciting thing is that the cost of finance in simulation is negligible than experiments such as High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope and the result would be extremely similar. Furthermore, it is imaginable that there could be a part of world deduced by computer as long as we could translate the nature rules into program language even we only need to train the machine learning algorithm to imitate the nature rules, then we could get guidance from the virtual world to the real world, that process is just like we train an expert in specific area with pretty low cost and then get guided from him. When this idea appeared in my mind, I thought I had found my way to my goal.
Since this idea came to my mind, I had a conscious to learn computer theory from Internet, and to practice my program skill, at the meantime I kept looking for internship opportunities in the computer industry. After graduating from Tsinghua University, I was fortunate to receive exercitation offer from Beijing Kedong Electric Power Control System Co., Ltd--a subordinate company of State Grid Corporation, which is concentrating on power network automation system development. I was assigned to develop new power network model for the new generation power network automation system, my main work is to reprogram the logic function layer, so that it could fit the new power network model and the function is guaranteed correct. I achieved a full training in reading and coding with C++&JAVA language in that period, and more important, I got an overall comprehension of the software engineering industry. That is distinctive compared with material research or other industry field, software engineers strive for not only the product property but also the customer experience, In addition, logical thinking plays an extremely important role while a new software is designed. I was immersed in the process of programing by applying the technology and theory just learnt from textbook.
It is another story that I took an internship in Neusoft Corp, which is the largest Chinese IT solutions and services provider. I was allocated to the project called “Customs Supervision Database and Express Supervision Center Computer Information Systems Integration” cooperating with Shenyang Taoxian International Airport. This project is committed to realize custom supervision and express management automation and integration. My job was developing the business function layer and insert layer of this system, the function layer realizes business logic and database storage by EJB, JMS, JAVA BEAN, CORBA and Middleware Technology, and the insert layer provides WEB & GUI access, supporting Socket, FTP, HTTP, HTTP/S, IIOP & MQ. Instead of practicing my programing skill, I got used to working till midnight and learnt to be patient enough to change my work according to the changes of customer demands. I also realized that I need to consolidate my understanding of computer theory and technology with the aim of being a professional software engineer.
